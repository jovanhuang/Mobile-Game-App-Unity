  hostDialogueSentences:
  - You were on your way home from work when you suddenly felt a tug on your backpack.
  - Someone had cut open your bag!
  - In the distance, you saw the thief holding your handphone.
  - '"HEY! THAT''S MINE!" you yelled angrily.'
  - He turned around, startled, and shove a cart of fruits in your direction. The
    fruits scattered all across the ground, slowing you down.
  - Alas! He weaved amongst the crowd and disappeared into the distance.
  - Eat the correct fruits to form a strong password (gain energy) and capture the
    thief!
  - Remember, a strong password consists of at least one special character, one uppercase
    character, one lowercase character, and one number.
